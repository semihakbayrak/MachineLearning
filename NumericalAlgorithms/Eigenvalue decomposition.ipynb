    "__Example 1 (PCA):__ Consider $N$ instances $x^{1:N}$ where each instance $x^i$ has $d$ features. All these data points are represented with $N \\times d$ dimensional matrix $X$ and the mean of the feautures and covariance between the features are $d$ and $d \\times d$ dimensional $\\mu$ and $\\Sigma$, respectively. Sometimes some of the features are highly correlated so not all the features are informative. We may then find a new lower dimensional ($k$ s.t. $k<d$) space where the data instances are scattered well and easily seperable. Let's get started with the first new dimension. Suppose a unit vector $q_1$ lies on this one-dimensional space. Then the projection of an instance $x^i$ on this space is $z_1^i = q_1^T x^i q_1$. Doing this projection to all instances we get $z_1^{i:N}$ with mean $m_1 = q_1^T \\mu$ and variance $v_1 = q_1^T \\Sigma q_1$. In order for these new instances to be scattered as much as possible, we want variance $v_1$ to be maximum. Therefore our task becomes: $\\underset{q_1}{\\text{max }} q_1^T \\Sigma q_1$ subject to $q_1^T q_1 = 1$. This objective is maximized with the largest eigenvalue of $\\Sigma$:\n",

    "__Example 3 (Spectral Embedding):__ For a given collection of data instances (such as photos, documents, twitter acounts), we may want to locate them in a lower dimensional space such that similar instances will be close to each other. In one dimensional space, this task refers to locating the instances on numerical axis. Similiarity between instances $i$ and $j$ is scored with $w_{ij} = w_{ji} \\geq 0$. This score can be based on any reasonable similiarity metric (such as sth based on pixel values, frequency of words appear in documents, or a graph structure that indicates the connections between the accounts). Instances $i$ and $j$ takes the values $x_i$ and $x_j$ on the numerical axis and all the values are stored in the vector $x = [x_1, x_2, ... ]$. We introduce an energy function to minimize to achieve this setting: $E(x) = \\sum\\limits_{ij}w_{ij}(x_i-x_j)^2$. Note that this would be minimized by setting all numbers to zero or equal to each other. We avoid this circumstances by additional two constraints that are $||x||_2^2 = 1$ and $1_d^T x = 0$ where $1_d^T$ is $d$ dimensional vector of ones. So the overall objective is:\n",
